# facebook-data-image-exif

This tool (in a PHP form) was [originally created in 2016](https://addshore.com/2016/09/add-exif-data-back-to-facebook-images/).

After many requests a less crappy version now exists with a simple UI.

## Usage
 * Download
 * Enter path to facebook images dir
 * Enter path of exiftool
 * Run
 * Wait
